          She took a few bites, but her thoughts were already elsewhere, imagining the streets of Porto and the stories
          she could tell her parents upon her return.

          At one point, she stopped, exhausted, and looked at her friend with pleading eyes. "Baptisteee, I can't take
          it anymore. Can you carry me for a little while, please?" she asked with a smile.

          discovered a large sign reading "Vila Nova de Gaia" with a spectacular panoramic view of the city and the
          river. Amazed by the beauty of the moment, Pixie took out her phone and snapped a photo, capturing the sign
          and the breathtaking view in the background.

          Porto. Despite her fear of heights, Pixie felt the urge to get closer to capture this unique moment.With her
          heart racing and her legs slightly trembling, she courageously advanced towards the edge of the bridge. Each
          step made her a bit more dizzy, and she even felt a slight nausea rising.With a strained but proud smile, she
          took a photo of herself with the spectacular view in the background. Although the experience was challenging,
          Pixie was immensely proud of having conquered her fear to capture this memory.

          headed to a small local café and decided to try a Portuguese specialty: the Pastel de Nata.

          Taking her first bite, Pixie was delighted by the sweetness of this pastry. "Yummmmm," she exclaimed, savoring
          each bite with pleasure. Thrilled to have stopped to taste this local delicacy, Pixie promised herself to come
